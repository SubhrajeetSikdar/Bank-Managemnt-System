# Banking System

This repository contains a simple banking system implemented in Python using MySQL database for storing account information and transactions. The system allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balances, and more.

## Features

- **Account Creation**: Users can create new bank accounts by providing their name, initial balance, and account type.
- **Deposit and Withdrawal**: Users can deposit or withdraw money from their accounts.
- **Check Balance**: Users can check their account balance.
- **Account Management**: Users can choose their account type (debit, credit, or both).
- **Loan Management**: Users can check if they are eligible for a loan based on their income and requested loan amount.
- **Statistics**: The system provides statistics like the number of accounts and the number of users.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for implementing the banking system.
- **MySQL**: The database management system used for storing account information and transactions.
- **mysql-connector-python**: Python library used to connect and interact with the MySQL database.

## Usage

1. Install MySQL and Python on your system if not already installed.
2. Create a MySQL database named `bank`.
3. Create a table named `accounts` with columns `id`, `name`, `balance`, and `account_type`.
4. Update the database connection details (host, username, password) in the Python script.
5. Run the Python script to start the banking system.
6. Follow the prompts to perform banking operations.
